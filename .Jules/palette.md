## 2024-04-15 - Dynamic ARIA Attributes Syncing
**Learning:** Found that interactive components like language toggles and mobile nav menus had static `aria-label` or missing `aria-expanded` attributes that didn't update when the UI state changed. This creates a disconnect for screen reader users where the visual state (like menu opening or language changing) isn't communicated properly.
**Action:** Always ensure that JavaScript toggles (like `.toggle()`) that change visual state also dynamically update corresponding ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`) so assistive technologies reflect the current state.
## 2024-05-10 - Canvas Animations and prefers-reduced-motion
**Learning:** Found that JavaScript-driven animations (like drawing on a `<canvas>`) are inherently immune to standard CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rules that globally kill CSS transitions and keyframe animations. Users who request reduced motion at the OS level to avoid vestibular discomfort would still experience continuous particle animations.
**Action:** Always verify `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches` in JavaScript before instantiating heavy/continuous visual animations on the canvas, and hide the canvas element if the user prefers reduced motion.
## 2024-06-29 - Mobile Menu Escape Key Accessibility
**Learning:** Custom mobile menus need an explicit keyboard trap or Escape key listener to close the menu and return focus to the toggle button, preventing keyboard users from getting stuck or losing context.
**Action:** Always implement an event listener allowing custom interactive overlay menus to be closed with the 'Escape' key, and verify that focus correctly returns to the toggle button upon closing.
